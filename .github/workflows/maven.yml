# This workflow will build a Java project with Maven, and cache/restore any dependencies to improve the workflow execution time
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-java-with-maven

# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.
# 以下情况发生时，触发jobs：1. push到main分支；2. pull main request分支；3. src目录下的文件发生变化；
# 4. github/workflows/maven.yml文件发生变化；5. pom.xml文件发生变化
